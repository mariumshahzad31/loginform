This project is a simple login form created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It contains two input fields, username and password, and performs basic client-side validation. The username field must not be empty, and the password must be at least eight characters long with at least one letter and one symbol. If all requirements are met, a success alert is displayed. The assignment demonstrates essential form handling and validation using JavaScript.
